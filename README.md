# Predict a Game's Tags from its Description
This is a data science project that uses a dataset of Steam games to try to predict a game's tags from just its description.  
  
The dataset is a heavily-cleaned version of the [80000 Steam Games dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepann/80000-steam-games-dataset) from Kaggle.
